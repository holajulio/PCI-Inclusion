                <h3>Previous Alliances and Collaborations</h3>
                <p>In recent years, PCI has had the privilege of collaborating with various organizations and entities committed to promoting racial equality and social inclusion. These strategic alliances have allowed us to expand our impact and reach more diverse communities in our quest for a more equitable and just world. One of our most significant collaborations has been with the Network of Organizations for Racial Justice (ROJR), a national coalition dedicated to addressing racial disparities and promoting equity in all spheres of society. Through this partnership, we have co-organized awareness campaigns, community events, and educational programs aimed at challenging stereotypes and combating racial discrimination in our communities.</p>
